# What Flower
## A flower recogniser app

This app uses the [Oxford 102 Flower dataset](https://github.com/jimgoo/caffe-oxford102) and [Wikipedia](www.wikipedia.com) to recognise, classify and show information about flowers.

This project was created as part of my Udemy course [iOS 12 & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/ios-12-app-development-bootcamp/)

It wasn't created for commercial purposes so please don't use it for such goals either.
